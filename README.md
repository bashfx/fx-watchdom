**Intelligent Domain Availability Monitoring with Phase-Aware Polling and a User-Friendly CLI**

`watchdom` is a professional, user-centric command-line tool for monitoring domain availability. It features smart, phase-aware polling that adjusts its frequency as a target time approaches, an extensible TLD system, and a robust, interactive user experience. Built following BashFX architectural principles for reliability and maintainability.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Phase-Aware Polling:** Automatically adjusts its polling frequency from a conservative base interval to an aggressive 10-second loop as your target time nears, and then gracefully cools down to conserve resources.
- **One-Time Queries:** Quickly check a domain's status with a single, non-polling query.
- **Extensible TLD Support:** Comes with built-in support for `.com`, `.net`, and `.org`, and allows users to easily add any other TLD via the command line or a simple configuration file.
- **Interactive Dependency Check:** Automatically detects if `whois` is not installed and interactively prompts the user to install it.
- **Rate Limit Detection:** Intelligently detects common rate-limiting messages from WHOIS servers and exits gracefully to prevent being blocked.
- **User-Friendly Prompts:** Features an "auto-yes" flag (`-y`/`--yes`) to streamline operation in automated scripts.
- **XDG+ Compliant:** Follows modern Linux filesystem standards for installation and configuration.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

First, make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x watchdom_advanced.sh
```

Then, run the installer:
```bash
./watchdom_advanced.sh install
```
The script will be installed to `~/.local/lib/fx/watchdom` and a symlink will be created at `~/.local/bin/fx/watchdom`. The script will notify you if you need to add this directory to your system's `PATH`.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Perform a single, immediate check for a domain
watchdom example.com

# Monitor a domain with a 10-second polling interval
watchdom example.com -i 10

# Monitor a domain until a specific drop time
watchdom example.com --until "2026-01-01 12:00:00 UTC"

# Add a new TLD and test it
watchdom add_tld .io whois.nic.io "is available for purchase"
watchdom test_tld .io my-new-app.io
```
