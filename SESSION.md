# Session Summary: The Evolution of `watchdom`

This document summarizes the development and refactoring process for the `watchdom` script, transforming it from a basic script into a robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich tool.

### 1. Initial Analysis and Refactoring

The project began with an analysis of the existing `watchdom_advanced.sh` script. The initial version had several issues, including a corrupted structure and inefficient argument parsing. The first phase of work focused on:
- Repairing the basic script structure to make it executable.
- Refactoring the argument parsing logic for clarity and correctness.
- Standardizing the script to be compliant with the **BashFX** architectural standard, which involved code reformatting, adding function comment bars, and ensuring consistent semicolon usage.
- Correcting file paths to be **XDG+ compliant**.

### 2. Iterative Bug Fixing and Feature Implementation

Based on extensive user feedback, a series of iterative improvements were made:

- **Argument Parsing:** A critical bug was fixed where command-line flags (`-i`, `--until`) were ignored when using the implicit `watch` command. The `main` and `dispatch` functions were completely refactored for robust parsing.
- **One-Time Query:** A new feature was added to allow for a simple, non-polling `whois` lookup by running `watchdom domain.com`.
- **User Experience (UX) Improvements:**
    - The `test_tld` command was enhanced to provide rich, verbose output by default.
    - A color formatting bug in the countdown timer was corrected.
    - A logic bug in the `_check_grace_timeout` function was identified and fixed.
    - All logging functions were refactored to correctly handle `printf`-style arguments.

### 3. Test Suite Development

A major focus of the project was the development of a comprehensive, automated test suite (`test.sh`). The test suite itself went through several iterations based on user feedback:
- **Initial Version:** A simple script to run basic commands.
- **UX-Driven Refactor:** The script was rewritten to provide clear, color-coded `[PASS]` and `[FAIL]` messages, numbered tests, and a final summary.
- **Robustness and Mocking:** After encountering sandbox limitations, the test suite was further refactored to reliably test complex scenarios, such as a missing dependency, by manipulating the `PATH` and mocking commands like `sudo`.

### 4. Final Feature Polish

The final phase of development added several "quality of life" features based on user suggestions:
- **Rate Limit Detection:** The script now intelligently detects common rate-limiting patterns from WHOIS servers and exits gracefully.
- **Interactive Dependency Check:** The script checks for its `whois` dependency and prompts the user to install it if missing.
- **Auto-Yes Flag:** A `-y`/`--yes` flag was added to allow the script to be run non-interactively.

The project concluded with a final, stable version of the script, fully verified by the robust test suite.
